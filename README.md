This repository serves as my blog for my Computer Science
(and maybe unrelated!) endeavours. The goal of this blog
is to deepen my understanding of concepts learned as
I progress through my studies as an Undergraduate in
Computer Science. As Einstein said,

> "_If you can't explain it **simply**, you don't
> understand it well enough._"
