In this blog post, I will quickly explain some
of the concepts we went over in **CSUN's** _Girl's Who Code_
hosted API workshop featuring **Luis J Guzman**,
a web developer at **CSUN**.

### The history of APIs

To start us off, Guzman briefly went over the history
of, well the **_internet_**. Trying to build our intuition
on the **idea** of APIs. To sum up everything
he explained:
> The entire internet is built on one idea,
> file sharing. Companies have grown to make 
> businesses out of this simple idea but 
>  the internet simply acts as a way to access,
> exchange, and share files with others globally.

This idea did intrigue me quite a bit since it gave me 
a new perspective on something I am already familiar with.
Websites don't literally give you anything, at the end
of the day the internet and all of its contents are 
merely 1s and 0s. But given a file with exclusivity
or one that requires a trade-off, one may receive 
benefits beyond the digital world. This is the internal
philosophy behind things like online shopping. But
in what way does this relate to APIs? Well, this whole 
spiel about the philosophy of the internet does relate 
to APIs in one simple way: APIs simply allow for websites
to access files.

### So... what is an API?

The acronym API stands for Application Programming Interface.
What it does is it allows programs that don't have data or **_files_**
built in to them to access files stored somewhere else on the internet,
usually in a database. For example, a user accessing website like YouTube
doesn't need to have every single video ever uploaded to YouTube
installed on their phone or computer. The YouTube application uses
and API to fetch the information on a video, which exists elsewhere. 
If this location, the one that actually contains the video, is accessible
to the public, than anyone can make a website similar to YouTube that 
streams the same videos that YouTube does.  
To explain it using an analogy, 
imagine a vinyl record store owner that has a huge inventory of records.
Struggling to get people to purchase from his store, he instead offers a 
new service. For a price, individuals can call the record store and listen
to their favorite album over the phone. If another individual had access
to the same library of records, they too can offer the service of playing
albums for customers over the phone. In this analogy, the service of 
playing the record is the API and the phone line would be the internet.
You can see how this analogy also ties into the idea that the entire 
internet is just file sharing, and that APIs are what grant applications
the ability to share files to an individual who doesn't have them. The API
communicates between the individual or program that doesn't have the 
information, and the one the does. 

### What an API looks like

Guzman did show us a few examples of what the
