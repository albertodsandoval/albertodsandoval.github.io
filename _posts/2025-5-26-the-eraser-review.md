Today I listened to *The Eraser* by Thom Yorke, the lead singer behind the critically acclaimed
and massively respected **Radiohead**. This post will highlight: my thoughts on this record as a whole,
my thoughts on each individual track, and a fun addition of assigning 3 adjectives to this record.

## The Review

I try to avoid using words that come off as elitist or stuck-up. I don't consider myself a *music enthuisast*
by any means and am not fond of the term, but it is true that I search for things in music that many don't.
Music tends to mean more to me than the people around me, but there is a massive population of people exactly like me.
And all of those people love **Radiohead**.

This isn't a blog post about Radiohead and their fantastic achievements, but I want to emphasize that I approach this album
knowing what Thom Yorke has been capable of creating in the past. Moving forward, I will avoid comparing this record to 
those of Radiohead's discography.

I ***really*** enjoyed this album. Going into it, I only knew two tracks, the self-titled track *The Eraser* and *Black Swan*. 
Other than these two tracks, I really am not familiar with any of Thom's solo work. I was pumped to really get in here and see
what he has been up to. Now that I have, I am *not* disappointed. The atmosphere of this record is haunting and anxiety-inducing. 

For some context, when listening to this album and as I am writing this review I am in a bus ride back to my college 
town after visiting home. It is pitch black outside and all the lights are off. I popped in my earbuds, layed back in my chair, 
and pressed play on this album. My setting absolutely enhanced the experience of this album and I am aware that this can affect
the score I will assign it, but I believe that I selected this album to listen to because I knew this would be the mood. And I 
believe that records deserve to be rated at their best, or in the way they were intended to be listened to.

This album features a variety of enticing and hypnotic tracks. It plays nicely, with no portion of the record feeling dominant to 
the other. The haunting synth cords, the ethereal harmonies, and the relentless beat featured in most of these tracks creates a 
very cohesive experience that leaves little to be desired. A handful of tracks also feature memorable choruses with emotional lyrics 
performed in Thom's usual addicting manner, self-titled track being a great example of this. 

Although the album hit many of the points I personally like to see in an album, I of course do not believe it is perfect. I would not
give a single track on this record a 10/10, which is especially unfortunate because many of them **have** the potential to reach that.
A lot of the tracks on this record are built on a very solid foundation, an undeniable groove, but few tracks build on top of that with
the same energy. 

Overall, *The Eraser* is a great late-night, dark, and suspenseful album with some attributes that **will** scratch that Radiohead itch. 
I think it is worth a listen to anyone who enjoyed Radiohead or anyone who is looking for a nearly spooky record for a midnight thrill.

**8.5/10**
